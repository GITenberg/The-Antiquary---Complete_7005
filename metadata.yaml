description: "The Antiquary (1816) is a novel by Sir Walter Scott about several characters\
  \ including an antiquary: an amateur historian, archaeologist and collector of items\
  \ of dubious antiquity. Although he is the eponymous character, he is not necessarily\
  \ the hero, as many of the characters around him undergo far more significant journeys\
  \ or change. Instead, he provides a central figure (and location) for other more\
  \ exciting characters and events – on which he provides a sardonic commentary. The\
  \ book is written in the third person so the narrative does not remain with the\
  \ antiquary.\nThis is Scott's gothic novel, redolent with family secrets, stories\
  \ of hidden treasure and hopeless love, with a mysterious, handsome, young man,\
  \ benighted aristocracy and a night-time funeral procession to a ruined abbey. The\
  \ romance and mystery is counterpoised by some of Scott's more down-to-earth characters,\
  \ and grittily unromantic events.\nScott wrote in an advertisement to the novel\
  \ that his purpose in writing it, similar to that of his novels Waverley and Guy\
  \ Mannering, was to document Scottish life and manners of a certain period, in this\
  \ case the last decade of the 18th century. Scott included a glossary of Scottish\
  \ terms as an appendix to the novel.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
